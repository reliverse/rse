## Contributing

A Bun monorepo created with the monorepo bootstrapper.

## Getting Started

```bash
bun install
```

## Workspaces

This monorepo was generated by `dler init`. It uses bun workspaces to manage multiple packages.

## Locations

- cli `rse` (v2): `./cli`;
- cli `rse` (v1): The implementation was moved to dler's repo into `./deprecated` directory;
- packages: `./packages/*`;

### Scripts

Run scripts across all workspaces:

```bash
bun --filter '*' <script>
```

Run scripts for specific packages:

```bash
bun --filter <package-name> <script>
```
