The `rse cmod` command allows you to easily apply powerful codemods (code modifications) to your project. Codemods automate complex or repetitive refactoring tasks, saving significant time and effort while ensuring consistency across your codebase.

## Features

- 🧩 **Interactive Codemod Selection**  
  Easily select and apply codemods from an intuitive prompt.

- ⚡ **Instant Refactoring**  
  Quickly apply multiple code transformations in one go.

- 🚀 **Safe and Reversible**  
  Codemods are applied intelligently, allowing you to review and revert changes as needed.

- 🎯 **Customized Refactoring**  
  Supports configurable codemods tailored to your project's specific needs.

## Getting Started

Install or update **@reliverse/rse**:

```sh
bun i -g @reliverse/rse
rse update
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Run `rse cmod` to launch the interactive codemod selection:

```sh
rse cmod
```

You'll be prompted with a checklist of available codemods to apply:

- ✅ Select the codemods you want.
- ✅ Confirm your selection to apply the changes.

### Direct Mode

Directly apply codemods by specifying their names:

```sh
rse cmod use-react-router-v6 migrate-to-nextjs-14
```

This command will instantly run the selected codemods without the interactive prompt.

## Example Codemods

Common codemods provided by rse include:

- **Framework migrations**:
  - React Router v5 → v6
  - Next.js v13 → v14
- **Syntax and API upgrades**:
  - React Class Components → Functional Components
  - JavaScript → TypeScript
- **Code Quality & Standards**:
  - Convert to ES Modules
  - ESLint and Biome rules standardization

## Example Usage

Quickly migrate your codebase to React Router v6 and convert class components:

```sh
rse cmod use-react-router-v6 class-to-functional
```

Interactively select and apply refactoring codemods:

```sh
rse cmod
```
